# Hire Chain

> Streamlining hiring for small and medium-sized businesses

## Overview

Hire Chain is a platform that enables small and medium-sized business owners to streamline their hiring process through the creation of a branded hiring page. Businesses can manage their job postings, candidates, and interview processes in one centralized location.

Candidates can apply to job postings within minutes through a frictionless application process (no account creation required). The platform uses a Linktree-style interface for the candidate-facing pages and Kanban boards for the business-facing candidate management.
